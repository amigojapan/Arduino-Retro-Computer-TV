Football rules
Coin toss.
Team that wins the toss elects to recieve or elects to defend which side of the field they want to play.
Kickoff
//if the ball goes mroe than 10 yards, it is a free ball(very rare)
other team catches the ball and tries to run as much as they can. ball must be in bounds if it falls out of bounds,
the revieving team gets it in their 40 yard line.
recieving team has the ball... 
Offence
must advance 10 yards to make first down, four downs and the ball possesion changes to the other team.
Long Pass 30% of the time(if you succedd you go far), short pass 40% of the time(but if you succeed you dont
 go far, but better yards than run), Run succsefull 50% of the time(if run doesnt succeed you can loose yarage).

when the pass in INCOMPLETE(falls to the floor) the yards don't advance.
Interception:
10% for long pass, 4% for short pass.(to make the game mroe exciting lets make thisn 25% and 10%)
3 down and you have not gotten 10 yards you have to punt(kicking the ball to the other side).

Defence
#5-4 red-dog
Defend against Long Pass, Defend Against short pass, Defend against run.

If ball goes past 99 yards, it is a touchdown.

question,. what do you call the kick where you try to kick it to the goalpost and can get points, hwo many points?   how many points for a touch down?
what about half times and stuff like that? does the ball change possesion at halftime? are there also quarters?
